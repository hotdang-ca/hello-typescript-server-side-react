# Server-Side Rendering with TypeScript-flavoured React JSX

## What is this?

See title. More specifically:

> This is a project to help me get aquinted with TypeScript, and React. And Server-Side Rendering. As React becomes more and more prevalent; React itself provides better methods for handling server-side renders, and TypeScript has surpassed Flow in terms of third-party type support, this super-team seems to be the way forward. And I want to get onto that boat!
